Welcome to Chronus, an elegant Home and Lock screen clock, weather and calendar widget.

Functionally the same as the CyanogenMod cLock widget and brought to you by the same developer, this independently released,
stand-alone widget takes back its original name, Chronus and brings the same elegant look and feel to the broader Android community.

<b>Please note:</b>
1) Lock screen widgets are only supported on Android 4.2+. This is a limitation of Android itself, not Chronus
2) On some devices you may have to reboot your device after installing for the widget to show up in the widget picker
3) WidgetLocker is not supported

<b>Features (Pro version):</b>
  - Custom Tap actions for Clock, Weather and Calendar to launch apps or activities

<b>Credits:</b>
Even though I wrote significant parts of the widget, lots of credit also goes to Danny Baumann for his work on the weather
updating service and general code cleanup, the many CyanogenMod community translators for adding all the languages that are
included, and other community contributors such as Nicolai Ehemann and Matt Booth for the fixes and additional features they
have contributed.
