Welcome to Chronus, an elegant Home and Lock screen clock, weather and calendar widget.

Functionally the same as the CyanogenMod cLock widget and brought to you by the same developer, this independently released,
stand-alone widget takes back its original name, Chronus and brings the same elegant look and feel to the broader Android community.

<b>Please note:</b>
1) Lock screen widgets are only supported on Android 4.2+. This is a limitation of Android itself, not Chronus
2) On some devices you may have to reboot your device after installing for the widget to show up in the widget picker
3) WidgetLocker is not supported

<b>Features (Pro version):</b>
  - Additional Widgets (Forecast, Calendar, Weather)
  - Custom Tap actions for Clock, Weather and Calendar to launch apps or activities

<b>Credits:</b>
Even though Danny Baumann and I wrote significant parts of the widget, lots of credit also goes to the many CyanogenMod and other community
translators for adding all the languages that are included, and other contributors such as Jorge Ruesga, Nicolai Ehemann and Matt Booth for
the fixes and additional features they have contributed.
